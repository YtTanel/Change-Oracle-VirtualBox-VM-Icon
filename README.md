# Change Virtual Machine Icon in Oracle VirtualBox
Made a Powershell script that allows you to change your Virtual Machine icon in Oracle VirtualBox using a simple GUI instead of a command line.

# Setup
Download script or clone repository to get started, nothing else to it.

### Ways to run it 
1. Right click on the file and click *Run with PowerShell*

2. Open PowerShell, go to the directory where the file is located and run command:
```
& '.\Change Virtual Machine Icon.ps1'
```

This was a little project I wanted to do, I rarely use PowerShell so this was a lot of fun :)
